This is a display of the fraction of people paying rent higher than 50% of their income in California. Select counties to look at a map of census tracts within that county.

The data were extracted from the 2016 5-year American Community Survey using [ACS Extractor](https://github.com/mattwigway/acs-extract). Note that I'm no ACS expert, and I think my calculation is wrong--the fraction represents the number of households (B25070_010) divided by the total population (B01001_001), and you'd either want to divide households by households or people by people.

So, how do I get the number of people in each household? I could use Public Use Microdata (PUMS) but that limits your geographic identifier to a Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA).
