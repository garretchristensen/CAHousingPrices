This repo contains files for a Shiny app that makes maps of California census tracts showing
fractions of households paying more than 50% of their income on rent.

Currently the calculations are incorrect (they're households/population) but it's probably a reasonable
first step to compare within/across counties, assuming the number of people per household isn't too strongly correlated with rent burden.
(It very well might be.)
